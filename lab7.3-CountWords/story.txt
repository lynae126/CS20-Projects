Rancher Croom in handmade boots and filthy hat, that walleyed, stray hairs like the curling fiddle string ends, that dancer on splintery boards or down the cellar stairs to rack of bottles of his own strange beer, yeasty, cloudy, bursting out in garlands of foam, Rancher Coom at night galloping drunk over the dark plain, turning off at place he knows to arrive at canyon brink where he dismounts and looks down on tumbled rock, waits, then steps out, parting the air with his last roar, sleeves surging up, windmill arms, jeans riding over boot tops, but before he hits he rises again to the top of the cliff like cork in bucket of milk.
